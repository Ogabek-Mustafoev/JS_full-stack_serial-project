            Drama is the specific mode of fiction represented in performance:
            a play, opera, mime, ballet, etc., performed in a theatre, or on
            radio or television.[1] Considered as a genre of poetry in
            general, the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the epic and
            the lyrical modes ever since Aristotle's Poetics (c. 335 BC)—the
            earliest work of dramatic theory.[2] The term "drama" comes from a
            Greek word "draō" meaning "to do / to act" (Classical Greek:
            δρᾶμα, drama), which is derived from "I do" (Classical Greek:
            δράω, drao). The two masks associated with drama represent the
            traditional generic division between comedy and tragedy. In
            English (as was the analogous case in many other European
            languages), the word play or game.

            Comedy (from the Greek: κωμῳδία, kōmōdía) is a genre of fiction
            that consists of discourses or works intended to be humorous or
            amusing by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, film,
            stand-up comedy, television, radio, books, or any other
            entertainment medium. The term originated in ancient Greece: in
            Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by
            political satire performed by comic poets in theaters.[1] The
            theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic
            performance pitting two groups, ages, genders, or societies
            against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye
            depicted these two opposing sides as a "Society of Youth".

          <div class="tabcontent__descr">
            A documentary film or documentary is a non-fictional
            motion-picture intended to "document reality, primarily for the
            purposes of instruction, education, or maintaining a historical
            record".[1] Bill Nichols has characterised the documentary in
            terms of "a filmmaking practice, a cinematic tradition, and mode
            of audience reception [that remains] a practice without clear
            boundaries".[2] Early documentary films, originally called
            "actuality films", lasted one minute or less. Over time,
            documentaries have evolved to become longer in length, and to
            include more categories; some examples being: educational,
            observational, and docufiction. Documentaries are very informative
            and are often used within schools, as a resource to teach various
            principles. Documentary filmmakers have a responsibility to be
            truthful to their vision of the world without intentionally
            misrepresenting a topic.

            Sport pertains to any form of competitive physical activity or
            game[1] that aims to use, maintain or improve physical ability and
            skills while providing enjoyment to participants and, in some
            cases, entertainment to spectators.[2] Sports can, through casual
            or organized participation, improve one's physical health.
            Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants,
            through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants,
            either in teams or competing as individuals. In certain sports
            such as racing, many contestants may compete, simultaneously or
            consecutively, with one winner; in others, the contest (a match)
            is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other. Some
            sports allow.

            The fantastic requires the fulfillment of three conditions. First,
            the text must oblige the reader to consider the world of the
            characters as a world of living persons and to hesitate between a
            natural or supernatural explanation of the events described.
            Second, this hesitation may also be experienced by a character;
            thus the reader's role is so to speak entrusted to a character,
            and at the same time the hesitation is represented, it becomes one
            of the themes of the work—in the case of naive reading, the actual
            reader identifies himself with the character. Third, the reader
            must adopt a certain attitude with regard to the text: he will
            reject allegorical as well as "poetic" interpretations
